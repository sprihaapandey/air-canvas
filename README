# Air Canvas 🎨

Air Canvas is an application that tracks the user’s **index finger** through a webcam to create drawings on a digital canvas in real time.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```

## Usage

Ensure proper lighting and availability of a webcam. Running paint_brush.py turns on the webcam and launches the digital canvas. Hold you your hand and point your index finger in front of the camera. Moving your finger should create drawings on the canvas. Move your finger to the menus to adjust color and brush size. Use the panel on the right to save or clear canvas
